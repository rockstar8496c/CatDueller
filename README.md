## Usage

- Download the release ending in "-clean.jar" and put it into your mods folder
- Open GUI with right control
- Start the bot with semicolon

## Description

A skid of hypixel duels bot [duckdueller](https://github.com/HumanDuck23/DuckDuellerKT) made by randoms who know fuck all about minecraft modding or programming in general and yet ask $30 for it.
The release is not even obfuscated, most of the project is just untouched duckdueller and not to mention it has laughable auth. So laughable in fact that a toddler could remove it.
Have fun using the clean version if you are a weirdo who bots hypixel duels in 2026.

## Pathetic attempt at tracking users

When I was removing whatever auth this dogshit had I stumbled upon this funny scene **(removed in the clean version)**

For some reason whoever the fuck made this decided that the $30 you give for it is not enough and they also what to track your games.

And it would not surprise anyone that this (now down) webhook belongs to a private channel in the devs discord server called "duels-logs-1".

}

Kinda weird how they have a whole websocket thing set up for auth and/or dodging other users but to track games they just send a webhook message. Whatever ai made this clearly knows better.
